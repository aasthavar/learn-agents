    "- The set of tasks that AI can do will expand dramatically because of agentic workflows\n",
    "- We have to get used to delegating tasks to AI agents and patiently wait for a response\n",
    "- Fast token generation is important. Generating more tokens even from a lower quality LLM can give goog Results.\n",
    "- If you're looking forward to running GPT-5/ Claude 4/ Gemini 2.0 (zero shot) on your application, you might already be able to get similar performance with agentic reasoning on an earlier model.\n"
