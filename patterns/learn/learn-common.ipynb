To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand. A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making \"remarkable achievements in a particular field\"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for \"holding an official position\" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for \"remarkable achievements in multiple fields\".Nen (念) is the ability to control one\\'s own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them, knowingly or not. There are four basic Nen techniques: Ten (纏) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense; Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one\\'s presence and relieving fatigue; Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen; and Hatsu (發) is a person\\'s specific use of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities; Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies; Manipulators (操作系, Sōsakei) control objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or properties of their aura; Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists (特質系, Tokushitsukei) have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories. A Nen user can enter into a Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are.

Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by Mito, Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is a Hunter as well. During the Hunter Exam Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight. After successfully becoming a licensed Hunter, Gon and Killua learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] After becoming one of the first people to beat Greed Island, and helping to stop the Chimera Ants, Gon meets his father.[ch. 335]. Following the meeting with his father, Gon decides to return to Whale Island and reunites with Mito [ch. 345]. Gon is a popular character with fans, coming in third place in the series' first two popularity polls.\\n\\n\\n=== Killua Zoldyck ===\\nVoiced by: Kanako Mitsuhashi (1999 series), Mariya Ise (2011 series) (Japanese); Annika Odegard (1999 series), Cristina Vee (2011 series) (English)Killua Zoldyck (キルア=ゾルディック, Kirua Zorudikku) is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful and mischievous boy who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. His ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him — deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and overall pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.[ch. 36, 37, 148] Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island, helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the dying Gon. As Gon is about to meet Ging, Killua decides to part ways and travel the world with Alluka [ch. 338].\\nConflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends, as Killua puts them before himself without a single complaint. His greatest flaw is initially his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him,[ch. 210] a result of Illumi's instructions to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength as a one-man killing machine. Killua has mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced.

Hunter: Phantom Rouge (Japanese: 劇場版 HUNTER×HUNTER 緋色の幻影(ファントム・ルージュ), Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Hantā Hantā: Fantomu Rūju) is a 2013 Japanese animated feature film based on the Hunter × Hunter manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi. It follows the four main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio as they face a dangerous individual who once was a member of their greatest enemies, the criminal organization known as the Phantom Troupe.\\nThe film was created by Madhouse and opened at number one in Japan on January 12, 2013. Viz Media released the film on home video in North America on February 13, 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nThe movie begins with Killua having a nightmare about his brother Illumi's warning to never make friends, claiming that eventually he will betray or get betrayed by them. He wakes up alongside Gon on an airship, where the former promises to never betray him. Upon arriving at their destination, they meet Leorio and learn that he and Kurapika were investigating a rumor about a survivor of Kurapika's Kurta Clan until they meet a young boy whom Kurapika recognized as his childhood friend Pairo, who attacks him and steals his eyes. Unconscious since then, Kurapika awakens beside the others and soon after he has visions through his stolen eyes of a man whose right palm is marked with a spider tattoo, the same used by the members of the Phantom Troupe.\\nBased on other details seen by Kurapika in his vision, Gon and Killua leave him under Leorio's care and split up in search for Pairo's location. Gon ends up meeting and befriending a young puppeteer called Retsu and when Killua reunites with him, they realize that Retsu is a girl. Because of Killua’s loyalty towards Gon, Killua quickly becomes jealous of her. When night falls, Leorio and Kurapika are approached by Hisoka while Gon and the others are attacked by Uvogin, who was presumed to be dead and saved by Nobunaga and Machi who defeat him. It is then revealed that Uvogin was revived as a puppet by Omokage, a former member of the Phantom Troupe who was defeated and replaced by Hisoka. Omokage sends a team of puppets including one based on  Pakunoda to attack his former companions but they are all destroyed by them. After Omokage retreats, Nobunaga and Machi leave as well, warning Gon and Killua to not stand between Omokage and the Phantom Troupe as they have a score to settle with him.\\nIn the next day, Retsu leads Gon and Killua to the mansion from Kurapika's vision and after leaving her behind for her safety, they meet another puppet, now based on Illumi who attacks them. Just as the Illumi doll is about to steal Killua's eyes, Gon intervenes and has his own eyes stolen instead. Ashamed for failing to protect Gon and believing that he had betrayed his friend, Killua flees and attempts suicide but is saved by Gon who had tracked him with his acute sense of smell. Gon then reveals that he had let the Illumi doll steal his eyes by his own volition so they could track down Omokage. He also states that he had long realized that Retsu was one of his puppets as well. Reunited with Leorio and Kurapika, they set for Omokage's location to confront him.\\nBack at his hideout, Omokage reclaims his eyes from Retsu, who is revealed to be a puppet made from his deceased sister and when Gon and his friends appear, he reveals that he let them track him down by purpose as he intends to claim Leorio and Killua's eyes to use on his puppets as well. After confessing to Kurapika that he also took part in the Kurta Clan's massacre and claiming that he currently has no other scarlet eyes in his possession, Omokage sends the Pairo and Illumi dolls to attack the Hunters, but Gon and Kurapika defeat them with Leorio and Killua's help and retrieve their eyes. However, Omokage activates six other dolls based on members of the Phantom Troupe to attack them but Hisoka appears to fight by their side. While Hisoka deals with three of the puppets, Omokage absorbs the other three to attain their powers and \", metadata={'title': 'Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge', 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge (Japanese: 劇場版 HUNTER×HUNTER 緋色の幻影(ファントム・ルージュ), Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Hantā Hantā: Fantomu Rūju) is a 2013 Japanese animated feature film based on the Hunter × Hunter manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi.

      "[Document(page_content='Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER and pronounced \"hunter hunter\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\\nThe manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Setting ===\\nHunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals, and can also access locations that regulars cannot. To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand. A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making \"remarkable achievements in a particular field\"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for \"holding an official position\" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for \"remarkable achievements in multiple fields\".Nen (念) is the ability to control one\\'s own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them, knowingly or not. There are four basic Nen techniques: Ten (纏) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense; Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one\\'s presence and relieving fatigue; Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen; and Hatsu (發) is a person\\'s specific use of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities; Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies; Manipulators (操作系, Sōsakei) control objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or properties of their aura; Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists (特質系, Tokushitsukei) have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories. A Nen user can enter into a Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order to have an unbreakable chain that will full', metadata={'title': 'Hunter × Hunter', 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER and pronounced \"hunter hunter\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi.

Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by Mito, Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is a Hunter as well. During the Hunter Exam Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight. After successfully becoming a licensed Hunter, Gon and Killua learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] After becoming one of the first people to beat Greed Island, and helping to stop the Chimera Ants, Gon meets his father.[ch. 335]. Following the meeting with his father, Gon decides to return to Whale Island and reunites with Mito [ch. 345]. Gon is a popular character with fans, coming in third place in the series' first two popularity polls.\\n\\n\\n=== Killua Zoldyck ===\\nVoiced by: Kanako Mitsuhashi (1999 series), Mariya Ise (2011 series) (Japanese); Annika Odegard (1999 series), Cristina Vee (2011 series) (English)Killua Zoldyck (キルア=ゾルディック, Kirua Zorudikku) is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful and mischievous boy who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. His ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him — deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and overall pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.[ch. 36, 37, 148] Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island, helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the dying Gon. As Gon is about to meet Ging, Killua decides to part ways and travel the world with Alluka [ch. 338].\\nConflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends, as Killua puts them before himself without a single complaint. His greatest flaw is initially his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him,[ch. 210] a result of Illumi's instructions to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength as a one-man killing machine. Killua has mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which he utilizes by altering his aura into electricity.

Hunter: Phantom Rouge (Japanese: 劇場版 HUNTER×HUNTER 緋色の幻影(ファントム・ルージュ), Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Hantā Hantā: Fantomu Rūju) is a 2013 Japanese animated feature film based on the Hunter × Hunter manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi. It follows the four main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio as they face a dangerous individual who once was a member of their greatest enemies, the criminal organization known as the Phantom Troupe.\\nThe film was created by Madhouse and opened at number one in Japan on January 12, 2013. Viz Media released the film on home video in North America on February 13, 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nThe movie begins with Killua having a nightmare about his brother Illumi's warning to never make friends, claiming that eventually he will betray or get betrayed by them. He wakes up alongside Gon on an airship, where the former promises to never betray him. Upon arriving at their destination, they meet Leorio and learn that he and Kurapika were investigating a rumor about a survivor of Kurapika's Kurta Clan until they meet a young boy whom Kurapika recognized as his childhood friend Pairo, who attacks him and steals his eyes. Unconscious since then, Kurapika awakens beside the others and soon after he has visions through his stolen eyes of a man whose right palm is marked with a spider tattoo, the same used by the members of the Phantom Troupe.\\nBased on other details seen by Kurapika in his vision, Gon and Killua leave him under Leorio's care and split up in search for Pairo's location. Gon ends up meeting and befriending a young puppeteer called Retsu and when Killua reunites with him, they realize that Retsu is a girl. Because of Killua’s loyalty towards Gon, Killua quickly becomes jealous of her. When night falls, Leorio and Kurapika are approached by Hisoka while Gon and the others are attacked by Uvogin, who was presumed to be dead and saved by Nobunaga and Machi who defeat him. It is then revealed that Uvogin was revived as a puppet by Omokage, a former member of the Phantom Troupe who was defeated and replaced by Hisoka. Omokage sends a team of puppets including one based on  Pakunoda to attack his former companions but they are all destroyed by them. After Omokage retreats, Nobunaga and Machi leave as well, warning Gon and Killua to not stand between Omokage and the Phantom Troupe as they have a score to settle with him.\\nIn the next day, Retsu leads Gon and Killua to the mansion from Kurapika's vision and after leaving her behind for her safety, they meet another puppet, now based on Illumi who attacks them. Just as the Illumi doll is about to steal Killua's eyes, Gon intervenes and has his own eyes stolen instead. Ashamed for failing to protect Gon and believing that he had betrayed his friend, Killua flees and attempts suicide but is saved by Gon who had tracked him with his acute sense of smell. Gon then reveals that he had let the Illumi doll steal his eyes by his own volition so they could track down Omokage. He also states that he had long realized that Retsu was one of his puppets as well. Reunited with Leorio and Kurapika, they set for Omokage's location to confront him.\\nBack at his hideout, Omokage reclaims his eyes from Retsu, who is revealed to be a puppet made from his deceased sister and when Gon and his friends appear, he reveals that he let them track him down by purpose as he intends to claim Leorio and Killua's eyes to use on his puppets as well. After confessing to Kurapika that he also took part in the Kurta Clan's massacre and claiming that he currently has no other scarlet eyes in his possession, Omokage sends the Pairo and Illumi dolls to attack the Hunters, but Gon and Kurapika defeat them with Leorio and Killua's help and retrieve their eyes. However, Omokage activates six other dolls based on members of the Phantom Troupe to attack them but Hisoka appears to fight by their side. While Hisoka deals with three of the puppets, Omokage absorbs the other three to attain their powers and \", metadata={'title': 'Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge', 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge (Japanese: 劇場版 HUNTER×HUNTER 緋色の幻影(ファントム・ルージュ), Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Hantā Hantā: Fantomu Rūju) is a 2013 Japanese animated feature film based on the Hunter × Hunter manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi.

However, the role of CRD in mammary gland morphology and aggressive mammary tumorigenesis and the molecular mechanisms underlying CRD and cancer risk remain unknown. We found that chronic CRD disrupted mouse mammary gland morphology and increased tumor burden and lung metastasis in a genetically engineered mouse model of aggressive breast cancer and induced an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by enhancing leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 4a (LILRB4a or LILRB4) expression. Moreover, CRD increased the M2 macrophage (anti-inflammatory) and regulatory T-cell populations but decreased the M1 macrophage (proinflammatory) populations. These findings identify and implicate LILRB4a as a link between CRD and aggressive mammary tumorigenesis.\\nTEASER: Circadian rhythm disruption enhances aggressive mammary tumorigenesis by elevating LILRB4a expression.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-03-18\\nTitle: A deep insight into ferroptosis in lung disease: facts and perspectives.\\nCopyright Information: Copyright © 2024 Zhang, Xiang, Ma, Guo and Zeng.\\nSummary::\\nIn the last decade, ferroptosis has received much attention from the scientific research community. It differs from other modes of cell death at the morphological, biochemical, and genetic levels. Ferroptosis is mainly characterized by non-apoptotic iron-dependent cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxide excess and is accompanied by abnormal iron metabolism and oxidative stress. In recent years, more and more studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to the occurrence and development of lung diseases. COPD, asthma, lung injury,'"

However, decisions\\naround what data is retained or removed during this initial stage is\\nunder-scrutinized. In our work, we ground web text, which is a popular\\npretraining data source, to its social and geographic contexts. We create a new\\ndataset of 10.3 million self-descriptions of website creators, and extract\\ninformation about who they are and where they are from: their topical\\ninterests, social roles, and geographic affiliations. Then, we conduct the\\nfirst study investigating how ten \"quality\" and English language identification\\n(langID) filters affect webpages that vary along these social dimensions. Our\\nexperiments illuminate a range of implicit preferences in data curation: we\\nshow that some quality classifiers act like topical domain filters, and langID\\ncan overlook English content from some regions of the world. Overall, we hope\\nthat our work will encourage a new line of research on pretraining data\\ncuration practices and its social implications.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-12-13\\nTitle: High-accuracy Vision-Based Attitude Estimation System for Air-Bearing Spacecraft Simulators\\nAuthors: Fabio Ornati, Gianfranco Di Domenico, Paolo Panicucci, Francesco Topputo\\nSummary: Air-bearing platforms for simulating the rotational dynamics of satellites\\nrequire highly precise ground truth systems. Unfortunately, commercial motion\\ncapture systems used for this scope are complex and expensive. This paper shows\\na novel and versatile method to compute the attitude of rotational air-bearing\\nplatforms using a monocular camera and sets of fiducial markers. The work\\nproposes a geometry-based iterative algorithm that is significantly more\\naccurate than other literature methods that involve the solution of the\\nPerspective-n-Point problem. Additionally, auto-calibration procedures to\\nperform a preliminary estimation of the system parameters are shown. The\\ndeveloped methodology is deployed onto a Raspberry Pi 4 micro-computer and\\ntested with a set of LED markers. Data obtained with this setup are compared\\nagainst computer simulations of the same system to understand and validate the\\nattitude estimation performances. Simulation results show expected 1-sigma\\naccuracies in the order of $\\\\sim$ 12 arcsec and $\\\\sim$ 37 arcsec for about- and\\ncross-boresight rotations of the platform, and average latency times of 6 ms.'"
