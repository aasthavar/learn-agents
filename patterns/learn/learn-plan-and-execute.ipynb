    "1. ReAct \"Action Agents\". pseudo-code:\n",
    "    - some user input is received.\n",
    "    - the agent decides which tool - if any - to use, and what the input to that tool should be.\n",
    "    - the tool is called with that tool input, and an observation is recorded (this is just the ouput of calling that tool with taht tool input)\n",
    "    - that history of tool, tool input, and observation is passed back into the agent, and it decides what step to take next.\n",
    "    - this is repeated until the agent decides it no longer needs to use a tool, and then it responds directly to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. challenges with above paradigm:\n",
    "    - user objectives are becoming more complex.\n",
    "    - developers and organizations are starting to rely on agents in production\n",
    "\n",
    "3. longer prompt sizes, reasons:\n",
    "    - as objectives are more complex, more and more past history is being included to keep the agent focussed on the final objective while also allowing it to remember and reason about previous steps\n",
    "    - as developers try to increase reliability they are including more intructions around how to use tools\n",
    "\n",
    "4. summary : increasing complex abilities and increased reliability. Enters plan and execute to save the day...\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plan and execute. pseudo-code:\n",
    "    - plan steps to take.\n",
    "    - for step in steps: determine the proper tools or other best course of action to accomplish that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. core agent framework: planner, executor\n",
    "\n",
    "7. planner: \n",
    "    - llm: focussed on returning a plan\n",
    "    - output parser: parse the raw llm output into a list of strings (each string being a step).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. executor:\n",
    "    - Action agent\n",
    "    - take a high level objective (a single step) and figure out which tools to use to accompolish that (could be done in one step or two).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. benefits:\n",
    "    - approach separates out planning from execution - this allows one LLM to focus exclusively on planning, and another to focus on execution\n",
    "    - easier in the future to swap out these components for smaller fine tuned models\n",
    "    - however, due to the separation of concerns we’re hopeful that these calls can be to smaller (and therefore faster and cheaper) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. the major downside of this approach is that it takes a lot more calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. future directions:\n",
    "    - Better support for long sequences of steps. Right now the previous steps are passed around as a list - as planning steps getting longer and longer, we’ll want to store this in a vectorstore and retrieve intermediate steps\n",
    "    - Revisiting plans. Right now there is one planning step at the start, but then that is never revisited. It is likely we will want to have some mechanism for revisiting and adjusting the plan, either every step or as needed.\n",
    "    - Evaluation. Right now, a lot of these improvements are largely theoretical, or at the very least not benchmarked. We hope to have more rigorous ways of evaluating agent frameworks.\n",
    "    - Selection of execution chain. Right now, there is a single execution chain. It could easily be the case that you would want multiple execution chains, and the planner can specify which one to use. For example, if you have one execution chain optimized for web research, one for analysis, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. `Note: It should be noted that for many of these future directions we can draw inspiration from existing work. For example, BabyAGI already uses a vectorstore to store intermediate steps and also revisits planning each iteration. The Plan-and-Solve paper does more rigorous evaluation of outputs with benchmarks.`"
