    "- reflexion is a paradigm that uses **verbal reinforcement** that gets encoded in an agent's memory.\n",
    "- reflexion converts feedback from the environment into linguistic feedback, (like self-reflection) which is inserted into context for an LLM agent in the next episode. This helps the agent rapidly and effectively learn from prior mistakes leading to performance improvements on many advanced tasks.\n",
    "- three distinct models:\n",
    "    - **actor**: generates text+actions. use CoT, ReAct for this.\n",
    "    - **evaluator**: score outputs produced by actor. different rewarding functions are used depending on the task (llm and rule-based heuristics are used for decision-making tasks).\n",
    "    - **self-reflection**: generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the Actor in self-improvement. uses reward signal + current trajectory + persistent memory.\n",
    "- steps:\n",
    "    - define a task\n",

      "Summary: \"Speed of Sound\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all members of the band for their third studio album, X&Y (2005). Constructed around a piano and guitar riff, the song builds into a huge, synthesiser-heavy chorus. It was released by Parlophone Records as the lead single from the album. \"Speed of Sound\" made its radio premiere on BBC Radio 1 with Lamacq on 19 April, then was serviced to US radio on 18 April 2005. The song was released physically in Japan on 11 May with two B-sides: \"Things I Don't Understand\" and \"Proof\". In the United Kingdom, the single was issued on 23 May 2005.\n",
      "Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin admitted that the song was developed after the band had listened to English art rock singer Kate Bush. Upon the song's release, it charted in the UK Singles Chart in the number two position. In the United States, it debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, their first top ten hit in the country, and their most successful song until \"Viva la Vida\" reached number one in 2008.\n",
      "\"Speed of Sound\" was recognised Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and it was nominated twice at the 48th Grammy Awards. The song won a Brit Award in the category for Best British Single in 2006. The track's music video was nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards. \"Speed of Sound\" was also notable as the billionth download from the iTunes Store.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The Wikipedia page provides helpful information about the song \"Speed of Sound\" by Coldplay, including that it was the lead single from their 2005 album X&Y.

      "Summary: X&Y is the third studio album by British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple. It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, as well as manager and creative director Phil Harvey's brief departure from the band. Producer Ken Nelson was originally tasked with producing the record; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded due to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art combines colours and blocks to represent the title in Baudot code.\n",

It was originally planned for American country star Johnny Cash to record it with lead singer Chris Martin, but Cash died before he was able to do so. The song \"Talk\" appeared in the track listing, although after it leaked online in early 2005, it was thought to have been downgraded to a B-side for the album's subsequent single releases.X&Y was released after a considerable amount of global anticipation. Overall reaction to the album was generally positive. Furthermore, it was a significant commercial success, reaching the number-one position in the charts of 32 countries around the world, including the United Kingdom (where it had the third biggest sales week in history at the time) and the United States (where it became Coldplay's first album to top the Billboard 200 chart). With 8.3 million copies sold worldwide, X&Y was the best-selling album of 2005, accumulating over 13 million units as of December 2012.
